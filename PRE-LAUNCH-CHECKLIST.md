## üîí SSL/HTTPS CONFIGURATION

### Why SSL is Critical
- **SEO**: Google penalizes non-HTTPS sites
- **Security**: Form data needs encryption
- **Trust**: Browsers show "Not Secure" without SSL
- **Requirements**: Your meta tags reference HTTPS URLs

### How to Get SSL Certificate

#### Option 1: Free SSL with Let's Encrypt (Recommended)
If hosting on:
- **VPS/Dedicated Server**: Use Certbot
- **Shared Hosting**: Check cPanel for "SSL/TLS" or "Let's Encrypt"

**Steps for most hosting:**
1. Log into hosting control panel
2. Find "SSL/TLS" or "Let's Encrypt" section
3. Select domain: `prosoundguy.com`
4. Click "Install Certificate"
5. Wait 5-10 minutes for activation

#### Option 2: Hosting Provider SSL
Many hosts include free SSL:
- **Netlify**: Auto SSL (just enable in settings)
- **Vercel**: Auto SSL (enabled by default)
- **Cloudflare**: Free SSL + CDN
- **GitHub Pages**: Free SSL (custom domains)

#### Option 3: Purchase SSL Certificate
- Namecheap: $8/year
- SSLs.com: $5/year
- Your domain registrar

### After Installing SSL

**1. Force HTTPS redirect** (add to `.htaccess` if Apache):
```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
```

**2. Update these files if domain differs:**
- sitemap.xml (line 13, 20, 27, 34)
- All HTML files with canonical URLs
- Structured data in index.html

**3. Test SSL:**
- Visit: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/
- Enter: prosoundguy.com
- Aim for: A or A+ rating
